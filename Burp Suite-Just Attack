The project includes the use of Burp Suite:Community Edition tool to find the vulnerability in a web application.
The site which was a target is http://testphp.vulnweb.com/
Burp Suite acts as an intermediate for the packet to be sent to the server.
It captures the request and also the critical credentials which are entered by the user.
We can run any kind of attack such as XSS,SQL injection etc using the payload of the website.
